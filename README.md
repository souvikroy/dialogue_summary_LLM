# Dialogue variation & specificity generation, then summarisation reducing toxic behaviours using LLM

In this notebook, I've shown deeply understanding of generative AI, describing the key steps in a typical LLM-based generative AI lifecycle, from data gathering and model selection, to performance evaluation and deployment

I described in detail the transformer architecture that powers LLMs, how theyâ€™re trained, and how fine-tuning enables LLMs to be adapted to a variety.
